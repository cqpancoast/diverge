# qrng

A lab at ANU is continually making measurements on the quantum vacuum and then putting binary versions of that up on the internet, solving a whole host of problems encountered by PRNGs (for low-number calculations â€” the measurements aren't carried out very fast).

This is some code that I adapted from https://github.com/pcragone/anurandom/blob/master/anurandom.py that works for students in the Computational Methods in Physics class that I am a course assistant for.

![Wow!](https://github.com/cqpancoast/qrng/blob/master/sample_output.png "splitting the universe")

This isn't the place to go into how quantum mechanics works (I've been thinking of starting a blog for years) but what you need to know is that there's a _totally real other universe_ where the numbers in this picture are different. Isn't that cool? If you DO want further explanation, contact me and I'll be happy to rant about it.
