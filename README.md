# qrng

A lab at ANU is continually making measurements on the quantum vacuum and then putting binary versions of that up on the internet, solving a whole host of problems encountered by PRNGs (for low-number calculations â€” the measurements aren't carried out very fast).

This is some code that I adapted from https://github.com/pcragone/anurandom/blob/master/anurandom.py that works for students in the Computational Methods in Physics class that I am a course assistant for.
